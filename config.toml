When it comes to IaC I’m a Terraform convert, however, I can also use Cloudformation when required.

Working across many different verticals it's great to see how DoiT can bring those folks' knowledge to other businesses whilst changing the model of consultancy. I was responsible for winning key deals in cloud transformation and migration scenarios. My focus was on AWS/GCP and winning migration deals to these hyperscalers. The deals were often worth several million over a three-year period and needed careful planning and negotiation to ensure the best deal for the customer, satisfying CxO needs and requirements. I also helped a small team of architects ramp up our AWS game and bring new competencies and Managed Service Practise (MSP) to the business generating even more opportunities for business. This has ticked all my boxes in allowing me to be hands-on technical whilst managing a team and creating new ideas."
